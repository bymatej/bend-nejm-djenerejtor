Bend Nejm Đenerejtor - Worst app ever for generating band names in Croatian

This is an unnecessary Django app that the World doesn't need. 

It has around 1000 artist names (stored in Django's DB). Band names are in English. OK, it's not just bands, there are standalone artists there too, but I was too lazy to remove them. I'll ask ChatGPT to do it for me if it can. If not, this project will be worse, which is better! :) 

Yes... about the project...  
The band names are in English. They are translated in Croatian, but not using Google Translate, but by using sdgjskhgfklsjgkbsdgh translate (I don't remember the name so I put sdgjskhgfklsjgkbsdgh). This translator does not work very well with Croatian which is perfect!  

The idea is to get pretty silly suggestions for band names.  
The app will randomly pick two band names, it will randomly pick one word from each band's name and will attempt to translate it.  

Don't name your band using this app!
