Bend Nejm ƒêenerejtor - Worst app ever for generating band names in Croatian

This is an unnecessary Django app that the World doesn't need.

It has around 1000 artist names (stored in Django's DB). Band names are in English. OK, it's not just bands, there are
standalone artists there too, but I was too lazy to remove them. I'll ask ChatGPT to do it for me if it can. If not,
this project will be worse, which is better! :)

Yes... about the project...  
The band names are in English. They are translated in Croatian (but before that, they're translated from English to
Swahili, from Swahili to German, from German to French, and then from French to Croatian) using Google Translate.

The idea is to get pretty silly suggestions for band names.  
The app will randomly pick two band names, it will randomly pick one word from each band's name and will attempt to
translate it.

Don't name your band using this app!
